  DEPRECATED: Product Detail Page - Micro-trust Icons
  
  This snippet has been deprecated in favor of the canonical trust_line block.
  Do NOT use this snippet. It remains for backward compatibility only.
  
  The trust_line block in main-product.liquid is now the CANONICAL source
  for trust messaging on PDP. It shows max 4 items with subtle styling.
  
  Migration: Replace {% render 'pdp-micro-trust' %} with the trust_line block
  configured in the Shopify Customizer.
  
  This file will render nothing to prevent duplicate trust messaging.

  Trust indicators are now handled by trust_line block in main-product.liquid.
  
  Previous content showed:
  - Envío Gratis
  - Pago Seguro
  - Garantía 30 días
  - Calidad Premium
  
  This created duplication with trust_line block.
